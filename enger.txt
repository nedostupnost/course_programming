I thought you were everything
I thought you were the one
But once again I'm still blind
By the fake mask of life
Again I fell for its trap
Again I felt for its lies
And now you are leaving
And I'm begging you to stay
What we had was something special
What's going on?
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm torn open
I'm on my knees, asking you to stay and not to leave
Please don't go

Please don't go
